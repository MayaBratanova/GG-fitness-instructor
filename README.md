This is the first site I created.
What did I use in the project?
- Jekyll
- SCSS
  * animation and transitions
  * variables
  * mixins
- Gulp

I needed around 2 weeks to create this site. 
This was my project with I defend at the end of the CSS Advanced course in SoftUni. 
A week before my defend, my teacher - Koko Dankov saw the project and told me that I have a lot of mistakes and 
I need to write more code. At this moment I was very sad. After 30 minutes I started to rewrite my project.
when I rewrite a project, I always write less code and the site look better than before.
